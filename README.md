# PipeDream
Coded in Dr.Racket. 

This project is an implementation of the classic Pipe Dream game developed in Dr.Racket. The game challenges players to build a continuous pipeline by connecting randomly generated pipe pieces within a grid before the flow of liquid starts. Players must strategically place each piece to extend the pipeline, creating a complex path that avoids leaks and maximizes length. This project focuses on managing game state, rendering the grid and pipe pieces, and implementing game mechanics such as piece placement, and scoring based on successful pipeline construction. The project demonstrates core principles of functional programming, interactive graphics, and state management in Dr.Racket.
